# Note Taker

In this project, I created an application that can be used to write, save, and delete notes. This full stack application uses an Express backend and save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.


## User Story

AS a user, I want to be able to write and save notes. I want to also be able to delete notes I've written before so that I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete.

## Business Context

For users that need to keep track of a lot of information, it's easy to forget or be unable to recall something important. Being able to take persistent notes allows users to have written information available when needed.
